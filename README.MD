- The grammy library is used to create a new instance of a Telegram bot by passing in the bot token.

- A simple menu is created using the @grammyjs/menu library, which provides an easy way to create interactive menus.

- The menu is added to the bot's middleware stack using the bot.use() method. This makes it interactive and allows the user to select options.

- The /start command is handled using the bot.command() method. When the user sends this command, the bot sends the menu to the user.

- All other messages are handled using the bot.on() method. When the user sends a message, the bot echoes back their text by sending a new message with the same text.

- Finally, the bot.start() method is called to start the bot and listen for incoming messages and commands.
